# Bonk-a-Dodge

This was a graded university project. The commit history has been altered for the publication on GitHub.

The task was to create a simple video game that is both visually appealing and uses sound effects and music
to enhance the gameplay experience.

The game itself had to be implemented using [Processing](https://processing.org).
The sound effects and music had to be played by a [Max](https://cycling74.com/products/max) patch.
Communication between the Processing program and the Max patch had to be performed
using the Open Sound Control protocol.
